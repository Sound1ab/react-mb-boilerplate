As well as being more economical it is also a lot more reliable and in a different league when it comes to comfort – there’s none of the bone-jarring ride and heavy steering you’ll find in other taxis, which can take a real toll by the end of a 12-hour shift.” <br /><b>London Cabbie Michele Berti</b>',
